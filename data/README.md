# Data

The data directory holds /test and /official, which are used for storing the
input files for all Advent of Code run throughs.

## File Structure and Naming Convention

The data files are separated by the year to which they belong. Each file
follows the naming convention of `day_input_number(.test).txt`

For example:

```{bash}
/data
    /2019
        1_1.test.txt
        2_0.txt
    /2020
    /2021
```

A test input will have a `.test.txt` suffix while the regular inputs do not.
